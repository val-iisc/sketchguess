## Stroke sequence dataset
In our approach, we use sketches from [TU-Berlin dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/). Each sketch is represented as a sequence of strokes. In the WordGuess-160 dataset, the stroke sequences are paired with corresponding guesswords. As a preprocessing step, each stroke sequence image is morphologically dilated (`thickened'). The dataset of thickened stroke sequence can be accessed at the following [link]() as a .tar.gz archive. The archive contains two directories `sketches_png_css_thickened` and `sketches_png_css_thickened-sym` . The files should be accessed from the latter directory (i.e. `sketches_png_css_thickened-sym`).
